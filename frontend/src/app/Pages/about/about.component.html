                I work with Angular (Typescript) to create solutions for business problems. 
                I love the artistic nature of the frontend, and I am excited to continue to grow
                and explore other framworks like React. I also have experience in the backend. 
                I have utilized .NET core to create fullstack applications, and have worked with
                Google's Firebase BaaS for a lightweight application. Having this experience allows
                me to further my abilities in the frontend!
